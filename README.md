# Libraries:
 * graph.h: general graph stuff
 * euler.h: test if graph is Eulerian, find Euler-cycle.
 * path.h: Singly-linked list structure to store paths in
 * fib\_heap.h: generic fibonacci heaps
 * graph\_alg.h: currently MST for undirected graphs

 * digraph.h: better directed graph stuff
 * digraph_alg.h: max-flow with push relabel

# Programs:
 * Eulerweg.c: check if input graph is connected/Eulerian, find Euler-cycle if both.
 * mst.c: Find MST in connected undirected graph
 * heap\_test.c: interactive fibonacci heap
 * heapsort.c: test program to sort numbers
 * bfs.c: find shortest path in indirected graph with BFS
 * max-flow.c: find maximal s-t-flow in directed graph

# Rubbish:
 * menger.c: this doesn't work
 * old_menger.c: this doesn't either
