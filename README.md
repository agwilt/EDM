# Libraries:
 * graph.h: general graph stuff
 * euler.h: test if graph is Eulerian, find Euler-cycle.
 * path.h: Singly-linked list structure to store paths in
 * fib\_heap.h: generic fibonacci heaps
 * graph\_alg.h: currently MST for undirected graphs

# Programs:
 * Eulerweg.c: check if input graph is connected/Eulerian, find Euler-cycle if both.
 * mst.c: Find MST in connected undirected graph
 * heap\_test.c: interactive fibonacci heap
 * heapsort.c: test program to sort numbers
